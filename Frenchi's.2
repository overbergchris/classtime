<h3>Frenchi's Deli: Making Sandwiches Great Again</h3>
<p>Although Frenchi's Deli has been on campus for only 2 years, it has quickly made a name for itself. From the incredible sanwiches to the unbeatable customer service, Frenchi's has become a staple for many of the residents of South Oakland, myself included. If you have not expereinced Frenchi's for yourself, you are truly missing out on great food and great people.</p>

<p><a href="http://frenchisdeli.net/">Frenchi's Deli</a>, opened in 2014, is located at the corner of <a href=https://www.google.com/maps/place/449+Atwood+St,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15213/@40.4371065,-79.9548691,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8834f18882ec3cef:0x3b9c53617321dca2!8m2!3d40.4371024!4d-79.9526804">Atwood and Dawson Street</a>. While it bears the name deli, Frenchi's has anything a resident of South Oakland could need. The business' motto? "If we don't have it, you don't need it." While it offers anything you could need, there are two huge reasons people continue to come back: the mouthwatering sandwiches and Frenchi himself.

If you're a first time Frenchi's customer, getting a sandwich is a must. The <a href="http://www.allmenus.com/pa/pittsburgh/502374-frenchis-deli/menu/">menu</a> has a wide variety of sandwiches, but one of the best sellers is the Le Frenchi's Chicken and Steak Combo, commmonly referred to as the Le Frenchi. However, you really can't go wrong when ordering at Frenchi's. Not only does the food taste great, the portions are generous as well.

<h3>History of Frenchi's</h3>
<p>Frenchi is, not surprisingly, a native of France. He came over to the United States after he recieved a scholarship to play basketball at a high school in Florida. After working in Cleveland for a deli there, Frenchi came to Pittsburgh to open a second store of the deli he was working at in Cleveland. When his boss decided that he did not want to open a store here, Frenchi called his brother, and they liked the location so much they opened up their store in Oakland in 2014. Almost immidiately, the market became a hit. Everytime you walk in the door, you are greeted with an enthusiastic "Hello!" from Frenchi. He'll easily make conversation with you and encourage you to try something new from the menu. If you got a sandwich last time, he'll urge you to get a wrap this time and vice versa. He quickly realized that people would come to his store to buy just about anything. Often times he would hear people request something, and he would go out of his way to order it so that the next time that person would come in, what they wanted would be in the story.
